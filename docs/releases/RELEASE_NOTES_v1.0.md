This release marks the **constitutional freeze** of Agent Constitution.

v1.0 is not a feature milestone.
It is a **governance milestone**.

---

## What Is Frozen in v1.0

- A single, sealed constitutional document defining:
  - role authority
  - responsibility boundaries
  - explicit failure signals

- A final authority layer (`CONDUCTOR`) with the exclusive power to:
  - continue
  - iterate
  - terminate

- A role system where:
  - no agent is autonomous
  - no agent is complete
  - no agent may approve its own work

From this release onward, **governance precedes behavior**.

---

## What v1.0 Is Not

- It is not an optimization of agent performance
- It is not an orchestration framework
- It does not aim to maximize task completion

Stopping is considered a correct outcome.

---

## Compatibility and Scope

Agent Constitution is **model-agnostic by design**.

This release has been validated in OpenCode-style multi-agent orchestration
and reference-tested with DeepSeek models.

These environments are reference implementations,
not dependencies.

---

## Change Policy After v1.0

- The constitutional document is sealed
- Amendments require explicit versioning
- Agent definitions may be clarified but not expanded
- Documentation may evolve without redefining authority

This release establishes the **rules under which future changes may occur**.

---

## A Note on Language

The constitutional document is authored in Chinese
to preserve semantic precision and authority.

English documentation explains the system,
but does not override the original constitution.

---

## Final Remark

Agent Constitution does not try to make agents smarter.

It tries to make systems harder to corrupt.

v1.0 declares that boundary.
