# Why the Constitution Is Written in Chinese

The constitutional document of this system is authored in Chinese by design.

This is not a matter of localization preference,
but a decision driven by **precision and authority**.

## 1. Precision Over Fluency

The constitution defines:
- authority boundaries
- failure signals
- termination conditions

These concepts require **exact wording**.
The original language preserves semantic precision
that may be diluted by early translation.

English explanations may exist,
but they are interpretations, not substitutes.

## 2. Authority Has an Origin

Every governance system has a source of authority.

In this project:
- the constitution is the authority
- the original language is part of that authority

Translations are welcome,
but they must defer to the original text.

## 3. Separation of Explanation and Enforcement

This repository intentionally separates:
- **enforcement documents** (the constitution)
- **explanatory documents** (README, docs)

The former prioritizes correctness.
The latter prioritizes accessibility.

They serve different purposes
and are not required to be symmetric.

## 4. An Open Invitation, Not a Barrier

Writing the constitution in Chinese is not meant to exclude.

It signals that:
- the system has a clear intellectual origin
- governance rules are not casually mutable
- understanding precedes modification

Contributors are encouraged to:
- translate
- explain
- adapt

But not to redefine authority implicitly.

This document exists to clarify intent,
not to defend a choice.

The system works the same in any language.
The constitution does not.
